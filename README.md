A weather app  designed to provide users with up-to-date information about current weather conditions, forecasts, and other related data for specific locations. 

### Run the project
- install dependecies: ```sh npm i``` 
- add to the root folder a file called '.env' and in that file add this variable: VITE_API_KEY=DGxDU483Tuah4uIzqJKu1OGflb5H7DQV (you can also use your own API key) 
- Start the on localhost:5173 : ```sh  npm run dev ```

NOTE:When opening the website, the default location will be the current location of the computer from which the website is running using the GeoLocation API (the location is not necessarily the most accurate)
